Problem Statement
Team,

- First, we'd like a form where customers can fill out their feedback.
- customer details
- allow them to rate various aspects of their dining experience.
- After submitting their feedback, they should see a thank-you message
- information to be saved securely, so it's accessible later.

Secondly, we need a way to view all the feedback submissions. Ideally, this would be a list or table that shows all the entries we've received. It should be easy to navigate and review the feedback, even after refreshing the page. We think having some advanced options like filtering the data could be useful, but we're open to suggestions on the best way to present and manage this information.

- type-safe,
- user-friendly
- visually appealing
- smooth transitions
- quick loading times.
